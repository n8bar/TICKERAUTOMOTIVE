Wheel Alignment Making sure that your wheel alignment is correct is one of the most important things you can do to properly care for your tires. A poorly aligned car will unevenly wear your tires at an alarming rate. If left uncorrected, you may need to buy new tires much sooner than anticipated! Our certified service team would like to invite you to our shop for a wheel alignment service that could extend the life of your tires. The actual wheel alignment itself doesn’t just involve the wheels or tires, it includes adjusting the vehicle’s suspension systems. Our team knows how to adjust these sophisticated systems so that your car drives with exceptional precision. Here is a list of signs that indicate you need a wheel alignment: • Uneven tire wear • Drifting to one side or another on the road while driving straight • Vibration in the steering wheel Even if you don’t notice any of these signs, you may still need a wheel alignment as part of your warranty agreement. Come see our local auto repair center for a wheel alignment!
