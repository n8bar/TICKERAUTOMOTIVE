Pre-Purchase Inspection
There’s no need for you to rely on luck when purchasing a used car. You need to know the history of the vehicle before you make that big decision. The majority of dealerships around the country offer services such as a Carfax report in order to assist in shining some light on the history of the vehicle. Bear in mind that even though these pre-purchase reports can tell you the history of the vehicle, they cannot tell you for certain whether the vehicle is safe to drive or not.

It is extremely important for vehicles to have the proper preventative maintenance. A pre-purchase inspection can give you an experts opinion on the vehicles systems and parts. For example, inspecting a used vehicles tires, engine, hoses, belts and other important engine components can determine the difference between asking the price of the car, or the never-ending investment in repair bills.
