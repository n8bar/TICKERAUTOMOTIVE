When To Replace Timing Belt or Chain?
At some point during your vehicle's life, you will have to change the timing belt. The majority of vehicles require that the timing belt needs to be replaced at 100,000 miles. Some cars have timing chains instead of a timing belt. These timing chains can still stretch or break and could be noisier. The owner's manual of your car will tell you when you have to change your timing belt. You have to change it before it becomes a serious problem. A lot of vehicles have complicated internal systems that must work in perfect synchrony all together, and when the timing belt breaks, the internal parts of the engine are destroyed, and the synchrony is gone. This happens so fast that you might not get a warning.

While You’re At It…
When you are having your timing belt replaced, there is another component that runs on this belt, and that is your water pump. We advise you to replace your water pump at the same time you are replacing your timing belt. As a matter of fact, they are most commonly done together because when we have to replace your water pump, we have to do almost the exact same work as replacing your timing belt. This does not apply to all makes of vehicles, but it does apply to most of them.

At our auto repair shop, our certified technicians have been replacing timing chains, timing belts, and water pumps for years. If your vehicle needs a new timing belt or timing chain, give us a call or schedule an appointment online.
