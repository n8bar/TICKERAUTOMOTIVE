Clutch Repair and Services
How a Clutch Works
The majority of people assume that the purpose of the clutch is just to put the car in neutral gear. However, there's more to that, because it disengages the transmission from the drivetrain.

While the engine is on, it is designed to be constantly spinning. If the engine is not spinning, it would stop running and shut down. The motion is transferred to the drive shaft by the transmission and, in turn, to the wheels. However, you certainly don't want your transmission or your wheels to be spinning all the time. The main purpose of the clutch is to disengage the transmission from the motor in order for you to shift gears without grinding.

Clutch Service & Clutch Replacement
Over time, the clutch wears out, but its repair is not difficult compared to the more complicated transmission repair. In some cases, you have to replace the entire clutch if it has been worn out completely. Other common problems with the clutch include a leak in the hydraulics, air bubbles formed in the hydraulic line, and stretched cable controls.
