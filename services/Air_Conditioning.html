Automotive AC Service and Repair
If you drive a car that has no A/C, you are about to experience an uncomfortable and sweaty ride. Having a properly working A/C in your car can keep you and other passengers cool and comfortable during the entire ride. The certified technicians at our repair shop are highly trained in A/C recharge and evacuation and can assess interior climate control issues.

The main function of the air conditioner in your car is to cool the air that is coming into your passenger compartment using 3 main parts: the condenser, evaporator, and compressor.

When you come to our auto repair shop, this first thing our technicians will do is to discuss the faulty A/C system symptoms with you. After that, they will perform a visual inspection of the air conditioning compressor drive belt, serpentine belt, and all other accessible components for damage, leaks or cracks. Then, they'll inspect the operation of the air conditioning compressor. They'll evacuate the refrigerant from the system if no damage or leaks are found, vacuum test it and recharge the A/C system with the help of an appropriate refrigerant that complies with your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations.



Detecting damage or leaks to the A/C system of your vehicle sooner rather than later can save you both time and money, keeping you and everyone in your car cool and worry-free. Call us today or come to our auto repair shop and schedule an appointment with our technicians!
