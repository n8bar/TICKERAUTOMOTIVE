Radiator Repair and Services When you are driving your vehicle, certain parts of your engine create friction, and that same friction generates heat. It can be quite a challenge to keep up with the cooling system maintenance of your vehicle. However, our friendly, trustworthy, and professional team of certified mechanics specializes in various auto repair services, including radiator repair and radiator flush, and we can keep your car in proper working order. The cooling system of your car is what keeps it from having a meltdown. All of the components in the cooling system join forces to meet one important goal, which is moving coolant around your engine so that it can absorb and dissipate heat. The main purpose of the cooling system is to reduce the temperature in order to help all other parts of the engine work properly. The standard cooling system is made up of the following components: • Thermostat and housing • Thermo-time switch • Water pump • Electric cooling fan • Radiator and hoses When our technicians perform a radiator repair and flush, they will inspect: • Your fluid level • Signs of corrosion and oxidation • If all parts, including the thermostat and fans, are working properly • Belts and hoses for signs of fractures or leaks • Fluids or deposit that might show indications of leaks or damages If you don't maintain your car's cooling system, it might result in serious damage or even a complete failure of your engine. A flush is recommended every 2 years. Schedule your next radiator repair and flush with us and our certified technicians will assist you in keeping your car running for a long time!
