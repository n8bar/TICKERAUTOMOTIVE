If you need to jump-start your battery every time you start your car or the new battery that you just installed is still not holding a charge, there's a decent chance that the real problem at hand is your alternator. The alternator provides electricity to different components in your car, such as the air conditioner and dashboard lights, all while you are driving. Any additional power created by the alternator is stored for later use in your car’s battery. If your battery is not charged by the alternator, this means that you will have to deal with the frustration of a dead battery the next time you try to start your car. This situation is often misdiagnosed as a result of a bad battery, especially if it’s an old one. However, you can save both time and money by getting your vehicle serviced properly by our experienced and trained technicians. Bring your vehicle to our auto repair shop for top-notch alternator repair and replacement!
