Belts & Hoses Belts and hoses are major support systems that power nearly everything in your automobile, including the cooling system, charging systems, A/C, and more. Hoses deliver hydraulic pressure whereas belts transfer mechanical energy from the crankshaft to other systems. Both are typically made of rubber, which is vulnerable to heat, chemicals, and other stressors of driving.
