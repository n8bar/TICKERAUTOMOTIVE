Computer Diagnostics
When the check engine light of your vehicle is on, this is a certain sign that something is not right with one or more of your vehicle's systems. These systems are key components of your vehicle, so in order for it to run properly, they have to be in top condition.

If you want to know why your check engine light is on, visit our auto repair shop. We’ll begin the diagnostic by connecting a scan tool to the onboard computer system of your vehicle. This very same onboard computer system will communicate the issue to the tool. This will help our technician in tracking down the problem.

In the majority of cases, our technician manually go through a very complicated diagnosis flow chart procedure, so they can track down the problem and determine why it happened in the first place. This has to be done in order to repair your check engine light properly and prevent any serious problems in the future.
