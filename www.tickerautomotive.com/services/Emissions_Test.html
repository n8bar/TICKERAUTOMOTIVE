Emissions Test
Personal vehicle emissions add to the air pollution in many states. As a responsible driver, you care about aiding the national effort to reduce vehicle emissions—not just because all states have a vehicle emissions limit, but also because a vehicle that exceeds emissions limits is generally in poor repair, decreasing its safety and reliability. Because you depend on your vehicle for day to day needs, you want to keep it in the best repair possible. Our shop keeps your car in top condition by offering comprehensive emissions testing as well as superior customer service.

During an emissions test, our technicians will connect a device to the tailpipe of your vehicle while the engine is running to measure your automobile’s emissions while it is idle and while it is revving. We will compare our results to the state standards for your vehicle. We also check to make sure that your muffler is in good shape, and we will also make sure that your hoses and pipes are properly connected and working well.

From the moment you walk through our door until you leave satisfied with the results, our team strives to supply only the best service to you and your vehicle.

Many shops focus only on completing the work order, but our dedicated technicians go above and beyond to exceed your customer service expectations. Put our service to the test by calling our shop or stopping in to schedule an emissions test for your vehicle today!
