Cadillac, the second oldest American automobile brand, has been setting standards for automotive excellence since it became the first American car to win the Dewar Trophy from the Royal Automobile Club in England in 1908. A vehicle brand that markets itself as the “Standard of the World” needs an equally high standard of service.
