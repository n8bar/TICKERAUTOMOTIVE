Aston Martin, a London-founded company, is all about luxury sports cars. They have created many unique designs, including the foundation model 1939 Atom, the 1966 DBSC Touring Italian, which was designed to be a smaller and faster sports car, and, in more recent years, the 2001 V12 Vanquish and the incredibly rare One-77.
