Hyundai, headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, is the largest automobile manufacturer in South Korea and the second-largest automaker in Asia. The name Hyundai comes from a Korean word meaning “modernity,” and Hyundai’s recent innovations make their vehicles a perfect choice for today’s modern driver. As of 2011, Hyundai was the world’s fastest-growing car brand for two years running. A combination of technology and economy is what makes Hyundai vehicles extremely popular on the American market.
