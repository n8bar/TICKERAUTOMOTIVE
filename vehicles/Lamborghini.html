Ferruccio Lamborghini founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 with the goal of producing a superior grand touring car to compete with their competitors. The company's first models were released in the mid-1960s and were noted for their refinement, power, and comfort. The 350 GT was the masterpiece that established Lamborghini as a big-time player. It was first unveiled at the 1964 Geneva Motor Show, with a new engine, streamlined frame, and a more sophisticated designed body. The evolution of Lamborghini into today's market is quite astounding since the company has gone through many changes, but the idea is still the same.
