The Italian-based Fiat has a wider audience in Europe than in the United States, but its reputation for automotive excellence is world-wide. The European Car of the Year award was awarded to the Fiat Group twelve times between 1967 and 2008. Nine of those awards were won by Fiat Automobile models. Fuel efficient and environmentally friendly, Fiat automobiles are reputed to have some of the lowest average values for vehicle CO2 emissions. Distinctive in style with a flair for elegance, Fiats are a blend of innovation and class. You wouldn’t trust your world-class vehicle to just any mechanic. That’s why we’re here.
