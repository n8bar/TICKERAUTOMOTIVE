We encourage our customers to bring their Dodge vehicles in when the automobiles are approaching their factory-recommended mileage intervals for service. These maintenance appointments are important because little signs of wear and tear can be detected and addressed before these issues develop into safety hazards.

Whether your Dodge vehicle is in need of a basic oil change or a major repair, we can help. From simple services like a new battery or a belt replacement to more extensive repairs, we are happy to help you and put your worries to ease!
