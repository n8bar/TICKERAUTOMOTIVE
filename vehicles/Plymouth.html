The long and triumphant history of Plymouth cars is thanks to the words of Walter P. Chrysler himself, “Give the public something better, and the public will buy.” These vehicles are known for their durability, affordability, and engineering. These are the reasons why Plymouth has kept ahead of the curb and why consumers have continued to buy.

Plymouth has always forged ahead with new technologies, from developing the floating power method to designing an all-steel body. With all these new improvements, Plymouth was still accommodating the economic market demands with lower prices.
