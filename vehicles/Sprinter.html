Originally designed for businesses as a vehicle that could carry heavy loads, the Sprinter is an extremely popular van which has been selling in huge numbers since its launch in 1995. Since the launch of its first generation, the Sprinter has been manufactured under leading brand names like Dodge, Volkswagen, Freightliner and Mercedes-Benz. Although the frequent change in manufacturers, one thing has remained the same – its dependability.



Over the years, the Sprinter has dominated the van world setting the standards on safety, durability, environmental compatibility, comfort, and ease of operation. Its uses have evolved over the years due to its ability to be easily converted. The Sprinter has been sold as a disability van, recreational vehicle, shuttle, and even been adopted by some European countries as an ambulance.
