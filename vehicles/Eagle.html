Aimed at the enthusiastic driver, the Eagle was the marque of Chrysler Corporation in 1987. The Eagle had a unique touch compared to its competitors with its logo being an eagle and not the Chrysler Corporation "pentastar" logo. This small detail shows that the car was original, and like its driver, always ready to try something different.
