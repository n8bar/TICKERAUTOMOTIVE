Founded in 1909, this German luxury car manufacturer originally developed diesel and petrol engines for aircraft and then rail cars. It wasn’t until 1921 that the first experimental car was designed and introduced at the Berlin Motor Show. With a history of high-powered engines, it’s only natural to have a car that exemplifies that bigger is better. And you need a technician who is up for that challenge.
